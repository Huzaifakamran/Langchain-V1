I remember learning in school that France is known for cities like Paris, which is famous for the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. Wait, isn\\'t Paris the capital? I think that\\'s right. Let me check if there\\'s another city that might be confused with the capital. Cities like Lyon or Marseille are also in France, but I don\\'t think they\\'re capitals. Lyon is a major city in the east, and Marseille is on the Mediterranean coast. The capital should be the political and administrative center of the country. Paris has the government buildings, the president\\'s office, and the national parliament, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure Paris is the capital. I don\\'t recall any other city being mentioned in that role. Maybe I can think of other European capitals to cross-verify. For example, Germany\\'s capital is Berlin, Italy\\'s is Rome, Spain\\'s is Madrid. France\\'s capital should be Paris. I\\'m confident now that Paris is the correct answer.
